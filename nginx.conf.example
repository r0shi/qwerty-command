# Nginx configuration for QWERTY Command
#
# Include this in your nginx server block, or use it as a standalone config.
#
# For local development, you can also use:
#   - python3 -m http.server 8000
#   - npx serve .
#   - php -S localhost:8000
#
# Note: The game works fine from file:// in most browsers, but some features
# (like localStorage) may be restricted. A local server is recommended.
